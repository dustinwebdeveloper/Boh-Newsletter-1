            Dear XXX,<br>
            We are glad to share with you our new BOH BulleTEAn. This will be a monthly
            newsletter to keep you up-to-date on what is happening in BOH, some stories
            about Tea and fun stuff you can try at home(pssst...recipes!)<br>
            <br>
            We hope that you are safe during this challenging period. With most 
            Malaysians and people around the world being forced to stay at home, We
            have seen the demand for tea increase substantially. Thankfully, we are able
            to help meet this demand as the Malaysian government has designated BOH
            as an essential food item supplier and allowed us to operate according to the
            Movement Control Order guidelines.<br>
            <br>
            Despite us operating at minimum capacity, we have been up to the challenge
            to produce tea to meet demand. The BOH team is working hard in our
            plantations and at home (thank you technology) ensuring you get the best
            quality tea. The BOH online shop has also seen an uptake in orders and we
            are glad that people are thinking of us during this time. We will do our level
            best to serve you.<br>
            <br>
            The coronavirus has forced us all to accept a new normal and staying at home
            is key for us to fight off this virus. We hope what you read and watch in the
            BOH BulleTEAn will be helpful or just keep you occupied by yourself, or with
            family. Let us all continue to do our part and remember, stay at home, stay
            safe.<br>
